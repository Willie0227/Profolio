    <p class="educationPara">

        I am currently a High school freshman student, studying in Taiwan, Hsinchu County. The school I am in is the
        Pacific
        American School. I transferred to the Pacific American School in 2019 and stated the education there to prepare
        myself to attend college out of Taiwan.
    </p><br><br>

    <p class="educationPara">
        I like the education style in the Pacific American School because it provides me an environment with English
        teaching educations and also professional teachers experts on their major.

    </p>

    <p class="educationPara"><br><br>

        In my high school education, I also attend different sports clubs for after school activities, such as frisbee
        and badminton. These activities help me release my pressure on my homework load. More importantly, I believe
        that educations need to include some entertainment elements in order to let a person feel comfortable, instead
        of always focusing on reading, writing, and mathematics.

    </p><br><br>

    <p class="educationPara">

        In the future, I plan for my further education carrier to at least a master's degree. I want to focus on the
        major in Computer Science, which is one of my major hobbies. My dream is to become an engineer, hence, I take
        classes related to computer science, such as Java, C++, and APCS in the future.

    <h3 class="educationMore">Elementary</h3><br>

    <p class="educationMorePara">
        I spent 6 years in elementary school, Korrnell Academy. Kornell Academy is a bilingual education style school
        and follows the Taiwan government syllabus for the Chinese classes. On the other side, we also learned in
        English. The English classes followed what the teachers planned for us, instead of following the mandatory
        syllabus by the government.

    <h3 class="educationMore">Middle School</h3>

    <p class="educationMorePara">
        For my middle school education, I studied for one year at Taiwan local middle school. In the second year, my
        parent
        decided to transfer me to the Pacific American School for a different style and goal for my future education.
    </p><br><br>


    <h3 class="educationMore">High School</h3>

    <p class="educationMorePara">
        In 2020, I officially became a high school student, which is I am currently. For me, I feel the pressure on the
        homework load in every subject. I learn to manage my time well in order to make my life more organized. Until
        now, I
        hope I can succeed in the rest of my 3 years of high school life, and enter the target college of my goal.
